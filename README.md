# QuickCloud - ISIN 499 #

## Objective ##
To design and implement an easily-reproducible cloud infrastructure suitable for
hosting a small-business's website and database back-end, with few resource
requirements while maintaining strong security principles.

The infrastructure is specified, managed, and provisioned through various
machine-readable definition files, a process commonly referred to as
"Infrastructure as Code" (IaC).

## Tools ##
The following project utilizes both Terraform and Ansible to declaratively specify
our cloud configuration. The infrastructure is then deployed directly to AWS.
